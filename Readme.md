# GooberOSx86 (Ported to the Web)
________________________________

I was able to port GooberOSx86 to the web using the v86 library and their wasm files and script to be able to compile the entire OS including the emulator itself into a runnable HTML script that you can simply boot into without any need or requirement for server hosting. 

As of right now it's running the 0.11.3 version of GooberOS that is embedded into the HTML script.

## Example of the Task Manager

This was accomplished using a script to compile the proper strings of the base64 of the operating system, including the dependencies meant to run it like the Vga BIOS and emulation software.
